# Add Remote Management API

> **⚠️ SESSION WORKFLOW NOTICE (for AI Agents):**
>
> **This task should be completed in ONE dedicated session.**
>
> When you mark this task as `done`, you MUST:
> 1. Fill the "Session Handoff" section at the bottom with complete implementation details
> 2. Document what was changed, what runtime behavior to expect, and what dependencies were affected
> 3. Create a clear handoff for the developer/next AI agent working on dependent tasks
>
> **If this task has dependents,** the next task will be handled in a NEW session and depends on your handoff for context.

## Context
Cloud-mitmproxy and similar SaaS platforms need remote control of proxy instances via REST API. This enables:
- Starting/stopping the proxy listener dynamically
- Updating configuration without restart
- Retrieving current state and active connections
- Integration with control plane services

## Objectives
- REST API for proxy lifecycle management
- Configuration hot-reload support
- Active flow inspection and management
- JSON-based request/response format

## Tasks
- [ ] Add `POST /api/proxy/start` - Start proxy listener
- [ ] Add `POST /api/proxy/stop` - Stop proxy listener gracefully
- [ ] Add `GET /api/proxy/status` - Get proxy state (running, stopped, port, connections)
- [ ] Add `GET /api/flows` - List active/recent flows
- [ ] Add `GET /api/flows/{id}` - Get specific flow details
- [ ] Add `DELETE /api/flows/{id}` - Kill active connection
- [ ] Add `PUT /api/config` - Update runtime configuration
- [ ] API key authentication for management endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ **Lifecycle Control:**
- Can start/stop proxy via API calls
- Status endpoint reflects actual state
- Graceful shutdown completes in-flight requests

✅ **Flow Management:**
- List flows with pagination
- Filter flows by host, method, status
- View request/response bodies for specific flows

✅ **Security:**
- Management API requires API key header
- Health endpoints remain unauthenticated

## Technical Notes
- Extend existing Axum router in `src/api/`
- Use shared state (Arc<RwLock>) for proxy control
- WebSocket option for real-time flow streaming (future)

## Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Write integration tests if applicable
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass before marking task complete
- [ ] Consider edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always test AND run before committing!**

- [ ] **BEFORE committing**: Build, test, AND run the code to verify it works
  - Run `cargo build --release` (or `cargo build` for debug)
  - Run `cargo test` to ensure tests pass
  - **Actually run/execute the code** to verify runtime behavior
  - Fix all errors, warnings, and runtime issues
- [ ] Commit changes incrementally with clear messages
- [ ] Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "why"
- [ ] Consider creating a feature branch for complex changes
- [ ] Review changes before committing

**Testing requirements by change type:**
- Code changes: Build + test + **run the actual program/command** to verify behavior
- Bug fixes: Verify the bug is actually fixed by running the code, not just compiling
- New features: Test the feature works as intended by executing it
- Minor changes: At minimum build, check warnings, and run basic functionality

## Updates
- 2025-11-29: Task created

## Session Handoff (AI: Complete this when marking task done)
**For the next session/agent working on dependent tasks:**

### What Changed
- [Document code changes, new files, modified functions]
- [What runtime behavior is new or different]

### Causality Impact
- [What causal chains were created or modified]
- [What events trigger what other events]
- [Any async flows or timing considerations]

### Dependencies & Integration
- [What dependencies were added/changed]
- [How this integrates with existing code]
- [What other tasks/areas are affected]

### Verification & Testing
- [How to verify this works]
- [What to test when building on this]
- [Any known edge cases or limitations]

### Context for Next Task
- [What the next developer/AI should know]
- [Important decisions made and why]
- [Gotchas or non-obvious behavior]
